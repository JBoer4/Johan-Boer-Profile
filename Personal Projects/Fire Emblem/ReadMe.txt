Fire Emblem

Fire Emblem is a strategy game series with a multitude of characters each with their own stats, strengths and weaknesses.
I have done some work to analyze these characters with the hope to show using data which are good and which are not.
One of my major goals with this project is to quantify which units are good, and using those methods to qunatify the
units in a game I have not yet played to give some insight into what units I should use if I play the game.

Some problems in the way to getting a compact description of all the units any arbitrary game is:
getting the data out of the game
translating the data from one game such that it is comparable to other games
showing the most important insights in an easily digestable form while maintaing more detailed information for interested users

The most consistent way to get data from the game is to open the rom in the community built editor and manually extract the data
I wrote a script to automate this data collection and cleaning.
